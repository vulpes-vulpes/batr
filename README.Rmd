# batr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of batr is to streamline analyses and reporting of bat acoustic monitoring data containing [GUANO metadata](https://guano-md.org/). The package includes code to extract GUANO data directly from attributed WAV files, and to create summaries, plots and analyses.

The package is currently a work in progress. The basic functions work*, but may be buggy for different use cases. Improvements and additional features are planned as time permits. Feedback or contributions are welcomed. 

**Note**, the current release, 0.1.0, only functions for the eight bat species in Ontario. 

## Installation

Development is ongoing, but you can install the current version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vulpes-vulpes/batr")
```
## Using batr

### Formatting Data For Import:

#### Primary Data (WAV files):

Primary input data, in the form of [GUANO](https://guano-md.org/) attributed WAV files of bat echolocation calls, need to be arranged and attributed correctly to work smoothly with batr. Regardless of the recording and processing approach, _all_ WAV files should have the following GUANO fields at minimum:

* Timestamp (per [GUANO metadata](https://guano-md.org/) specification)
* Species Identification (Species.Auto.ID and/or Species.Maunal.ID)
* Loc Position (formatted as decimal lat / lon, e.g.: "00.000000 -00.00000", any number of decimal places can be specified)
* Location / Site Name (unique to each individual recording location, note that the [GUANO metadata](https://guano-md.org/)) specification does not define a specific field for these data, but batr requires it, users may choose their own field for these data and inform batr when using the `GUANO_loader` function) 

#### Tertiary Data (Recorder log / summary files):

Most automated bat acoustic monitoring hardware produce some form of log file to track device activity, errors etc. These files contain valuable data to determine survey effort: determining whether the unit was active at a given time. This is valuable for many analyses, especially those involving long-term data collection, because it makes it possible to determine whether a result of zero bats observed in a given time period occurred because there were zero bats, **or** because the recording device was inactive for any reason at that time. 

batr currently has the ability to import and parse such files from the following devices: 

* Anabat Swift: the daily CSV log files output by the Swift should be grouped in one directory per recording location, with te directory name **exactly** matching the Location / Site Name specified in the GUANO metadata of the WAV files
* Wildlife Acoustics SM3BAT, SM4BAT, SMmini: summary TXT files produced by Wildlife Acoustics recorders should be renamed to **exactly** match the Location / Site Name specified in the GUANO metadata of the WAV files, if there are multiple TXT files for the same monitoring location they can be distinguished with a counter following a hyphen in the file name (e.g. site-1.txt, site-2.txt)

If you wish to see log files from other devices support please get in touch and send example files, and I'll see what I can do. 

### Reading GUANO:

The `GUANO_reader` function (see below) examines all WAV files in a directory (and subdirectories), reads any [GUANO metadata](https://guano-md.org/) that are present into a table, and saves the resulting table as a tab delineated TXT file. **Depending on the number of files included, reading the metadata may take a long time** (thousands of files will easily take over an hour to read). The advantage of reading to a TXT file in this manner is that the resulting file is smaller, more portable and can read more quickly in future. A limitation is that if the GUANO metadata for any of the WAV files is modified, the TXT file must be recreated. Future plans include a mechanism for partial updates, and ultimately database integration. 

``` r
GUANO_reader(path_to_directory, project_name)
```

### Loading GUANO:

Once a TXT file has been generated using `GUANO_reader` function, it can be quickly loaded for further analysis. `GUANO_loader` will read the TXT file and produce four data frames in the environment: 

* clean_data_test: a tidied and sanitised version of the GUANO metadata, with key elements useful for further analyses
* raw_data_test: a full reproduction of the GUANO metadata of the WAV files
* species_night_site: counts of species observation per species per night per site
* species_site_summary: the total number of observations of each species at each monitoring location


``` r
GUANO_loader(file = path_to_TXT_file, dataset_name = project_name, town.location = )
```

### Importing Log Files:

These data can be imported using the `log_file_parser` function (see `?log_file_parser` for usage details). This function produces four data frames in the environment as follows:

* active_dates: Y/N output of whether each recorder was active on each night during the monitoring period 
* Gaps_test: monitoring gaps for each recorder (used to visualise survey effort in plots)
* monthly_active_nights: the number of nights that each recorder was active in each month
* uptimes: percentage uptime for each recorder throughout the monitoring period
