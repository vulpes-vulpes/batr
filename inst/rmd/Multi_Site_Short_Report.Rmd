# About This Document {-}

* The report was automatically generated from available data on `r params$date`
* Use caution, species knowledge, and common sense while interpreting these results, and consult an experienced bat biologist for further help
* Acoustic identification is challenging for many bat species, accordingly there may be some inaccuracies in the numbers of observations reported here
* The number of observations of a species cannot be directly equated to a number of animals: 100 observations could mean that 100 bats observed once or one bat observed 100 times

# Data Collection

`r english::Words(length(unique(observations$Location)))` ultrasonic recorders were deployed over a period of `r max(observations$Night) - min(observations$Night)` nights between `r min(observations$Night)` and `r max(observations$Night)`. Recorders occasionally fail to record on some nights due to exhausted batteries, full memory cards, or other faults. A list of recorders, precise locations, and the number of nights successfully monitored is displayed in Table \@ref(tab:locs) below. Recorder locations are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:map) above. 

```{r locs, echo=FALSE}
locations <- as.data.frame(cbind(unique(observations$Location), unique(observations$Latitude), unique(observations$Longitude)))
locations$uptime<- sapply(locations$V1, function(l) nrow(active_dates[active_dates$Location==l & active_dates$Log_Count > 0.5,]))
locations$uptime <- ifelse(locations$uptime < (max(observations$Night) - min(observations$Night)), locations$uptime, (max(observations$Night) - min(observations$Night)) )
colnames(locations) <- c("Location", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Nights Monitored")
kable(locations, caption = "Location names and coordinates for ultrasonic recorders included in these data.") %>% kableExtra::row_spec(0,bold=TRUE) %>%
kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 10)
```

Data were processed by `r params$author` staff. First, files that did not contain potential bat tonal signals were removed from the data, then the files were assigned species identities using SonoBat auto-classification software. Staff then manually checked all identifications of Endangered species and five percent of other species to confirm accuracy. 

# Results

A total of `r length(observations$Species)` combined acoustic observations of `r length(unique(observations$Species))` species were detected during this project. The total number of observations for each species at each monitoring location are given in Table \@ref(tab:species). 

```{r species, echo=FALSE}
qs <- batr:::.quick_summary(observations, active_dates, species = params$species)
qs$Year <- NULL
colnames(qs) <- c("", "Big Brown Bat", "Eastern Red Bat", "Hoary Bat", "Silver-haired Bat", "Eastern Small-footed Myotis", "Little Brown Myotis", "Northern Myotis", "Tri-colored Bat", "Number of Nights Monitored")
qs <- transpose(qs, keep.names = "Species", make.names = "")
kable(qs, caption = "Total species observations at each monitoring location.") %>% kableExtra::row_spec(0,bold=TRUE) %>%
kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 10)
```

Bat activity varied between nights. Nightly activity of each species at each site throughout the monitoring period is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:seasonal) below.

```{r seasonal, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.dim=c(10,13), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Nightly bat observations (coloured bars) by species and monitoring location. Grey blocks indicate time periods when acoustic monitoring did not occur."}
