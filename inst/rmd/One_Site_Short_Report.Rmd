# About This Document {-}

Thank you for participating in the `r lubridate::year(lubridate::now())` pilot Community Science bat monitoring project by the Toronto Zoo! This report is intended to provide fast feedback about the bats detected on your property. This document was automatically generated from available data collected on `r max(observations$Night)`, and is intended to provide a preliminary summary of your monitoring period. Full verification of species identifications, and further analysis of the results have not yet taken place and will be communicated at a later date. Please use caution while interpreting these results, and consult with the Toronto Zoo's Native Bat Conservation Staff with any questions. 

# Data Collection and Analysis

`r english::Words(length(unique(observations$Location)))` ultrasonic recorder was deployed over a period of `r max(observations$Night) - min(observations$Night)` nights between `r min(observations$Night)` and `r max(observations$Night)`. Specific location data is included in Table \@ref(tab:locs) below.

```{r locs, echo=FALSE}
locations <- as.data.frame(cbind(unique(observations$Location), unique(observations$Latitude), unique(observations$Longitude)))
locations$uptime <- max(observations$Night) - min(observations$Night)
# locations$uptime<- sapply(locations$V1, function(l) nrow(active_dates[active_dates$Location==l & active_dates$Log_Count > 0.5,]))
# locations$uptime <- ifelse(locations$uptime < (max(observations$Night) - min(observations$Night)), locations$uptime, (max(observations$Night) - min(observations$Night)) )
colnames(locations) <- c("Location", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Nights Monitored")
kable(locations, caption = "Location names and coordinates for ultrasonic recorders included in these data.") %>% kableExtra::row_spec(0,bold=TRUE) %>%
kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 10)
```

Data were processed by `r params$author` staff. After initial organisation and labeling the files were scrubbed to remove 'noise' files without any potential bat signals. The remaining files were then assigned species identifications using an automated classifier. This classifier is effective, but not perfect, and manual verification is required before these results are considered final.

# Results

A total of `r length(observations$Species)` acoustic observations observations of `r length(unique(observations$Species))` species were detected at this location. The total number of observations for each species at each monitoring location are given in Table \@ref(tab:species). 

```{r species, echo=FALSE}
qs <- batr:::.quick_summary(observations, active_dates, species = params$species)
qs$Year <- NULL
colnames(qs) <- c("", "Big Brown Bat", "Eastern Red Bat", "Hoary Bat", "Silver-haired Bat", "Eastern Small-footed Myotis", "Little Brown Myotis", "Northern Myotis", "Tri-colored Bat", "Number of Nights Monitored")
qs <- qs[, -c(10, 11)]
qs <- transpose(qs, keep.names = "Species", make.names = "")
kable(qs, caption = "Total species observations at each monitoring location.") %>% kableExtra::row_spec(0,bold=TRUE) %>%
kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 10)
```

Bat activity varied between nights. Nightly activity of each species at each site throughout the monitoring period is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:seasonal) below. Please note that the number of observations cannot be directly compared between species: this is because some bats are more easily recorded than others (for example: loud, low-frequency bats are easier to detect than quiet, high-frequency bats). 

```{r seasonal, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.dim=c(10,13), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Nightly bat observations (coloured bars) by species and monitoring location."}
batr:::.speces_site_plot(observations, text_size = 15)
```
