\title{Read GUANO Metadata From WAV Files}
\usage{
import_guano(
  action,
  input_path,
  site_col,
  timezone,
  data_path = NULL,
  fast_import = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{action}{Character. Must equal "New", "Add" or "Update". Use "New" to
read GUANO from a new set of files and create a fresh RData file. Use "Add"
to add GUANO from a new set of files to an existing RData file that already
contains other data. Use "Update" to update an existing RData files from
WAV that have been previously imported and then had their GUANO metadata
changed.}

\item{input_path}{Character. Path to the directory containing the files you
wish to read the metadata from. Note that sub-directories are also read.}

\item{site_col}{Character. Name of the GUANO metadata field specifying the
recording location / site name.}

\item{timezone}{Character. The timezone to be used for the timestamps in the
metadata in the TZ identifer format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of
_tz_database_time_zones), e.g. "America/New_York".}

\item{data_path}{Character. Path to an existing RData file. Optional when
"New" action is specified (a location will be requested before data are
read and saved). Required when "Add" or "Update" actions are specified.}

\item{fast_import}{Logical (default: TRUE). When TRUE, uses optimized single-pass
system calls to rapidly discover WAV files and their modification times. When
FALSE, uses standard R functions (slower but more portable).}
}
\value{
An RData file saved in a specified location containing GUANO metadata
  read from WAV files created through bat acoustic monitoring.
}
\description{
\code{import_guano} reads GUANO metadata stored in WAV files generated
through bat acoustic monitoring and saves them as a data.frame in an RData
file for easy reference. This function can generate a new RData file, add
GUANO from new files to an existing RData file, or update metadata in an
existing RData file where the metadata of the original files has changed.
}
\section{Note}{
 This function will take a long time for large data sets.
  Folders containing tens of thousands of files may take several hours to
  read! For this reason it is recommended to complete all manual vetting
  before proceeding. However, files with changed metadata can be updated later
  using the "Update" action.
