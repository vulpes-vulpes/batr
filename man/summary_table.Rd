\usage{
summary_table(
  data_path,
  species_list = NULL,
  location_list = NULL,
  include_totals = TRUE,
  species_names = NULL,
  sort = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_path}{Character. Path to an existing RData file containing
observation data.}

\item{species_list}{Character vector. Species codes to include in the summary.
If \code{NULL} (default), includes all species found in the dataset.
If specified, filters to only those species and adds empty columns for
any species in the list that don't appear in the data.}

\item{location_list}{Character vector. Location names to include in the summary.
If \code{NULL} (default), includes all locations found in the dataset.
If specified, filters to only those locations and adds empty rows for
any locations in the list that don't appear in the data.}

\item{include_totals}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), adds a "Totals" row
at the bottom summarizing counts across all locations.}

\item{species_names}{Named character vector for custom species labels. Names should be
species codes from the data, values should be display names. If NULL (default),
species codes are used as column headers.}

\item{sort}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, sorts locations and species alphabetically
when no explicit list is provided. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of observations summarized by location and species,
  optionally with a "Totals" row at the bottom.
}
\description{
Returns a table summarizing the total number of observations by site and
species.
