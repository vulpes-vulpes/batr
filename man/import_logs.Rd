\title{Parse Recorder Activity From Log Files}
\usage{
import_logs(
  log_path,
  data_path = NULL,
  monitoring_start = NULL,
  monitoring_end = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_path}{Character. Path to directory containing log files generated
by a Wildlife Acoustics SM3 or SM4 or Titley Anabat Swift bat recorder,
organised as outlined above.}

\item{data_path}{Character. Path to an RData file to add activity data to.
Optional, a save location will be created before data are saved.}

\item{monitoring_start}{Character. A date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
Optional: use to specify a monitoring start date prior to the earliest date
for which a log file exists.}

\item{monitoring_end}{Character. A date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". Optional:
use to specify a monitoring end date prior to the earliest date for which a
log file exists.}
}
\value{
An RData file containing a data.frame of recorder activity.
}
\description{
Reads log files created by acoustic monitors and determines their status
throughout a specified monitoring period. This information is essential for
interpreting patterns of bat activity because it effectively amounts to the
sampling effort. In other words, did you record no bats that night because
there were no bats, or because the monitor had run out of batteries...

\section{Note}{
 this function is currently only capable of parsing log files
  generated by either Wildlife Acoustics SM3 or SM4 or Titley Anabat Swift
  bat recorders.

 To work as expected, log files must be renamed following the
  conventions outlined below!

  \strong{Wildlife Acoustics:} These files should be renamed so that each
  file name begins with the site name followed by a hyphen and any additional
  information (e.g. date) that is desired in the file name. For example:
  "site_1-2019.txt". The hyphen and all characters that follow it will be
  disregarded. The site name should match the site name assigned in GUANO
  metadata so that the log file data is appropriately matched with the
  acoustic data.

  \strong{Anabat Swift:} These files do not need to be renamed, but files for
  each site should be placed in their own sub-folder. The folder name should
  match the site name assigned in the GUANO metadata of the corresponding WAV
  files so they can be matched.

  \strong{Anabat Ranger:} These files should be organised in the same way as
  those of the Anabat Swift described above.
